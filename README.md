#### Technical Skills: C/C++, C#, Lua, Python, Unity Engine, Unreal, DSA

## Work Experience
### Game Developer @ Learn with One
#### Game Developer
- Understanding the game mechanics of games developed in Unreal and implementing those in Unity.
- Clean Building games using WebGL and optimizing each project by 80% using the WebGL Optimizer saving up to 85% of space that was initially the size of the game.
- Reduced the size of the WebGL built game to approx. 66.6% of its original size by solely optimizing Textures and Sound Effects and Clips
- Identified steps to reduce development rates by 10% by using free assets imported from Sketchfab and Unity Asset Store.
#### Unity Developer
- Converting Rendering Settings, Material Upgrade & Animation Clip to URP from Built-in settings (SRP/HDRP) using the Render Pipeline Converter of Universal RP 14.0.11 Package from Unity Registry.
- Decreased uninstallation rate by 40% by introducing Endless Runner Genre to Educational Games.

### Open Source Contributor @ Sugerizer
#### 2023-2024	Sugar Labs	Austin, Texas
##### Sugarizer Web Platform 
- [#3701](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/pull/3701) (merged): Removed an extra if condition which was added for the resizing issue when the download toolbar used to appear at the bottom of Chrome. I also added an Exceptional handler in activity.js.
- [#9]((https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugarizer/pull/9)) (closed): Refactor input handling to prevent duplicate player Instantiation
- [#1536]((https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer/issues/1536)) (bug): Found a bug in sugarizer. The player was spawned without face and color from time to time.

- Utilized Unityâ€™s INetworkSerializable interface to synchronize game data across multiple clients, ensuring consistent game state and smooth multiplayer experience for up to 4 players.
- Created and managed core game state logic using KitchenGameManager, handling transitions between Countdown, GamePlaying, and GameOver, ensuring game flow and reducing errors by 30%. 
- Implemented reliable and unreliable Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) for efficient network communication, balancing performance and reliability based on the nature of game data, resulting in a 25% reduction in latency.
- Utilized the Singleton design pattern, ensuring a single instance. Employed data structures like event handlers and structs, leveraging OOP principles to improve code maintainability by 40% and scalability by 20%.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
